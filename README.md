# Calorie-Counter-Form-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-
A simple and interactive Calorie Counter Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to input their daily calorie budget and track calories for multiple meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The app then calculates and displays whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.


**JavaScript Logic Highlights:**

1. **Dynamic Meal Entries:** Users can add multiple food or exercise entries under each category dynamically.
2. **Input Validation**: Invalid number formats (like scientific notation) are detected and blocked.
3. **Calorie Calculation:** Calculates total consumed calories, exercise calories, and checks whether the user is in a calorie surplus or deficit.
4. **Live Result Display:** Shows personalized calorie result summary with dynamic styling.
5. **Form Reset Option:** Clears all inputs and results for a new calculation.
6. **Event Handling:** Uses event listeners for form submission, adding entries, and clearing form data.
